## Introduction

**Portmyfolio** is built to simplify the process of creating a personal portfolio website. It is a flexible and easily configurable npm package, built around a Next.js application. This package assists you in creating, editing, and customizing your portfolio by leveraging the Next.js application as a template.


## 📦 Installation

You can install the package globally and then use it inside the boilerplate repo consisting of a `port.json` file. This file is necessary for applying your configuration to the Next.js application.

```bash
npm i -g portmyfolio
```


## 🛠 Development

The package provides several commands to facilitate local development, building for production, and production server starting.

#### `portmyfolio dev`

Run this command in the root directory of your Portmyfolio project to view changes locally. It fires up a development server at `localhost:3000` and activates a web socket server at `localhost:8080` for hot reloading.

#### `portmyfolio build`

Use this command to create a production-ready build of your portfolio.

#### `portmyfolio start`

Execute this command to kickstart your production server.

### 🏃🏻‍♂️ Get Started

### 📝 Notes

- Portmyfolio requires Node v18 or higher. Please ensure that your environment meets this requirement before proceeding.
- You need the boilerplate repository for running the commands in, without it you won't be able to run any of the above mentioned commands.
